# 'The Simpsons' Giphy Page

Welcome to 'The Simpsons' Giphy Page - a hopefully-not-legally-vulnerable page for some of your 'Simpsons' gifs! 

The 'Simpsons' Giphy page has ratings, so some content may be PG-13 adjacent, but usually if that's the case the kids wont get the joke.  

The goal of this page is to let anyone search 'Simpsons' gifs in a slightly more streamlined way (not as good as Frinkiac, though).

To start press one of the pre-loaded gif buttons and watch the magic unfold. Once you've stopped laughing try adding a new gif button by typing in a search term and hitting "add gif." Because it's simpsons related you'll have the most luck with simpsons themed seaerches, so if you have a favorite character give them a search - who knew there were that many "bleeding gums murphy" gifs!

If you need any assistance or just have general questions please refer to a 'Simpsons' podcast, or watch an episode from the golden years.
